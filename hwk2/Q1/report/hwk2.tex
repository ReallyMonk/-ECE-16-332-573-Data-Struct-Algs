\subsection*{Question 1}
We know that insertion sort would face the worst case when the sequence is 
exactly reverse order. And for the usual case, it shows a better performence
when the sequence are almost sorted. And shell sort is actually taking some 
former step to sort part of the sequence first. Then it would be much more 
effective when doing the insertoin sort.
